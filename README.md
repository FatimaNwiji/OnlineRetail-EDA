# Online Retail Project 

Overview:
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an online retail dataset. The goal is to clean and visualize the data to uncover valuable insights into the company's sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a portion of an online retail dataset that contains information about various transactions made in a retail company. The columns in the dataset include:

- Invoice: Unique identifier for each transaction
- StockCode: Unique identifier for each product
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: Quantity of the product sold
- InvoiceDate: Date of the transaction
- Price: Price per unit of the product
- Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Country: Country where the transaction occurred

Project Goals:
1. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicate records, and invalid entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.
3. Data Visualizations: Create visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the data clearly and effectively.
4. Conclusion: Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
- Git and GitHub for version control
